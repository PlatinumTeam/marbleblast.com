        <h2>What happened?</h2>
        <p>
            Somewhere around 9AM on Feb 2, 2024, the server hosting marbleblast.com started showing signs of an
            infection.
            It isn&apos;t known exactly how it was attacked, but the OS and software running on it had not been updated
            for
            a number of years
            and it was inevitable that some botnet would succeed at exploiting it eventually. As a result, the site is
            currently offline
            as the team hosting it determine the next steps.
        </p>

        <h2>What is affected?</h2>
        <p>
            Anything hosted on the server behind marbleblast.com, namely:
        <ul>
            <li>The Marble Blast website</li>
            <li>The Marble Blast forums</li>
            <li>The PlatinumQuest Leaderboards</li>
            <li>Webchat</li>
            <li>PlatinumQuest <s>downloads and</s> updates</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>What is not affected?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Anyone who downloaded PQ, even recently, is not infected with anything</li>
            <li>The <a href="https://discord.com/invite/P3HtQAnVym">Discord</a> community</li>
            <li>Any player-run or community-run Dedicated Servers</li>
            <li>Control over the domain name &ldquo;marbleblast.com&rdquo; and DNS</li>
            <li>Donations put towards the hosting of the server</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Was data lost?</h2>
        <p>
            No. That being said, the data is only really usable by the still-vulnerable software that was running on the
            site,
            so &ldquo;putting it back up,&rdquo; even in a read-only format, is not viable as it will just get attacked
            again in the same manner.
            Someone with access to the site can pull a copy of the Leaderboards&apos; and Forums&apos; data from the
            nightly
            backup,
            but trying to convert it to a format usable by the community will likely take a significant amount of time.
        </p>

        <h2>When is it going back up?</h2>
        <p>
            Unknown. At this point the amount of work required to restart the services is likely greater than anyone is
            willing to put in.
            Parts of it could recovered independently, though:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Game assets and code are available on GitHub:
                <a href="https://github.com/The-New-Platinum-Team/">https://github.com/The-New-Platinum-Team/</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                An open-source rewrite of the PlatinumQuest Leaderboards was written a few years ago:
                <a href="https://github.com/RandomityGuy/Zenith/">https://github.com/RandomityGuy/Zenith/</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                The current Leaderboards code (including Webchat) is available on GitHub:
                <a
                    href="https://github.com/PlatinumTeam/MarbleBlast-Prod/">https://github.com/PlatinumTeam/MarbleBlast-Prod/</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                The forums were archived on archive.org recently:
                <a
                    href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240131115645/http://marbleblast.com/">https://web.archive.org/web/20240131115645/http://marbleblast.com/</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            So realistically, the only part that would be truly difficult to recover is an interactive version of the
            forums.
            Not that they saw much use these last few years, but they were a significant source of knowledge about the
            game
            that was easily searchable.
        </p>

        <h2>So what do I do now?</h2>
