    <h2>What happened?</h2>
    <p>
        Somewhere around 9AM on Feb 2, 2024, the server hosting marbleblast.com started showing signs of an infection.
        It isn't known exactly how it was attacked, but the OS and software running on it had not been updated for a number of years
        and it was inevitable that some botnet would succeed at exploiting it eventually. As a result, the site is currently offline
        as the team hosting it determine the next steps.
    </p>

    <h2>What is affected?</h2>
    <p>
        Anything hosted on the server behind marbleblast.com, namely:
        <ul>
            <li>The Marble Blast website</li>
            <li>The Marble Blast forums</li>
            <li>The PlatinumQuest Leaderboards</li>
            <li>Webchat</li>
            <li>PlatinumQuest downloads and updates</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>What is not affected?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Anyone who downloaded PQ, even recently, is not infected with anything</li>
        <li>The Discord server</li>
        <li>Any player-run or community-run Dedicated Servers</li>
        <li>Control over the domain name "marbleblast.com" and DNS</li>
        <li>Donations put towards the hosting of the server</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Was data lost?</h2>
    <p>
        No. That being said, the data is only really usable by the still-vulnerable software that was running on the site,
        so "putting it back up," even in a read-only format, is not viable as it will just get attacked again in the same manner.
        Someone with access to the site can pull a copy of the Leaderboards' and Forums' data from the nightly backup,
        but trying to convert it to a format usable by the community will likely take a significant amount of time.
    </p>

    <h2>When is it going back up?</h2>
    <p>
        Unknown. At this point the amount of work required to restart the services is likely greater than anyone is willing to put in.
        Parts of it could recovered independently, though:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Game assets and code are available on GitHub:
                <a href="https://github.com/The-New-Platinum-Team/">https://github.com/The-New-Platinum-Team/</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                An open-source rewrite of the PlatinumQuest Leaderboards was written a few years ago:
                <a href="https://github.com/RandomityGuy/Zenith/">https://github.com/RandomityGuy/Zenith/</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                The current Leaderboards code (including Webchat) is available on GitHub:
                <a href="https://github.com/PlatinumTeam/MarbleBlast-Prod/">https://github.com/PlatinumTeam/MarbleBlast-Prod/</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                The forums were archived on archive.org recently:
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240131115645/http://marbleblast.com/">https://web.archive.org/web/20240131115645/http://marbleblast.com/</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        So realistically, the only part that would be truly difficult to recover is an interactive version of the forums.
        Not that they saw much use these last few years, but they were a significant source of knowledge about the game
        that was easily searchable.
    </p>

    <h2>So what do I do now?</h2>
    <p>
        I dunno, go play <a href="https://marbleitup.com">Marble It Up!</a> instead? They have actual funding to maintain their infrastructure,
        at least for right now. If you want that authentic Marble Blast Gold experience, there's the
        <a href="https://mbhaxe.netlify.app/">Marble Blast Haxe Port</a> and <a href="https://marbleblast.vaniverse.io/">Marble Blast Webport</a>.
